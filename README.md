### Description
Small .NET project to help with the game *Escape from Tarkov*.

Currently features a simple and all-in-one game map viewer to easily swap out when needed, with the ability to add markers.

Initial development [started](https://github.com/jamesscully/tarkov/tree/8ac63d45bc11dc6ab28db97f0d3e883cb7efa9f2) with WinForms, however has switched to WPF to provide GPU-acceleration on the transformation of images (mapviwer).

I did not make any of the maps featured in the program.
